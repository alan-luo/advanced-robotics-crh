**What was the goal of this project?**

To create a system for the automated analysis of crops, with the eventual goal of interacting with these crops.

**What limitations exist for this system?**

The data is inconsistent and difficult to analyze. For instance, for the particular issue of weed identification, variations in weather conditions can  obscure certain features such as color.

In addition, for the function of weeding, the system cannot always remove an identified weed. It may remove a crop by accident, or not entirely kill the weed, which can lead to chemical resistance.

**Are there factors being simplified?**



**Who is the consumer here?**

Farmers / farm owners: in 2017, there's not much of a distinction. The objective is to save manual labor from these farmers. The guy in the podcast seems to insist that they're not really stealing jobs, and I think this is true to the extent that it only targets very basic manual labor. With the system as is (no weeding), the data must be analyzed anyway, so a farmer is still required for the effective utilization of the system.

**Is this the only project this team has done before in this field?**


**What are the potential implications of this being more widespread?**

Well, the obvious answer is replacement of jobs. However, realistically, I feel like the statement that the system makes is more important. As an example of what I mean, consider Amazon's drone delivery service. The fact that we get 1 hour delivery isn't as important as the fact that we now have drones flying around the city tracking our position.

In this case, I'm more curious about what this means for the future. Agriculture and farming has consistently been one of the least desirable jobs. Often, we use the portion of a population in agriculture as a metric for how developed a country is. With the expansion of automated agricultural systems, perhaps we're moving towards a world where basic human needs such as food are no longer actually handled by humans.
