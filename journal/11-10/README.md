# Fully Assembled Circuit

By this point, I had tested each component individually and had it all working on the same board.

Working video found at `/final_project/img/circuit_test.mp4`. In this video, I've replaced the motor with a basic LED transistor circuit because I'm trying to avoid burning anything out, and the motor draws a lot of power. In the video, all four components are running at once (DHT, light, servo, transistor), which also verifies that the Arduino can supply enough power to drive all that.
