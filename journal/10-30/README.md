# Parts List for Final Project (Ordering Parts)

We ordered these parts. I made a few changes to my list since last time.

I added a 7-12v high capacity battery. I don't really care what kind of battery this is, but the Arduino is not going to supply enough power to drive the motor, so I'm planning on using a transistor switch with a higher power battery.

Also, we already had a few LiPo batteries on hand, so I tested them to make sure that they could actually power the Arduino. Sure enough, they worked.
