# Oct 16: Brainstorming

On this day, I started my final project. Going into this project, I knew I wanted to build something that:

- Could interact with its physical environment
- Could take in data about its environment
- Could use the data to modify its interactions

With this in mind, I found a handful of projects particularly interesting.

**Music-playing Robot**

I had a long-standing desire to build a laser harp. However, such an electronic instrument has no inherent autonomous or interactive components. To make this harp autonomous, I would also build a robot to play the harp.

The end goal would be to make a robot that can listen to what you play, then (using machine learning) play back a reasonable response.

**Weather Station**

I could build a weather station to monitor the humdity, light, and temperature by my house. I'd interface it with some oAuth API to tweet data about my home. I could also add a webcam to take a picture every now and then, giving me my own little photographer robot.

**Sphero / BB8**

Make a remote controlled BB8 from Star Wars 7. This doesn't need explaining.

I ended up deciding to pursue the BB8 project.
