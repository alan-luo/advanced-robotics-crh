# Oct 16: Brainstorming

On this day, I started my final project. Going into this project, I knew I wanted to build something that:

- Could interact with its physical environment
- Could take in data about its environment
- Could use the data to modify its interactions

With this in mind, I found a handful of projects particularly interesting.

**Music-playing Robot**

I had a long-standing desire to build a laser harp. However, such an electronic instrument has no inherent autonomous or interactive components. To this harp autonomous, I would also build a robot to play the harp. 

**Weather Station**

**Sphero / BB8**

This was the project I ended up deciding to pursue.
