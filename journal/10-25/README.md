# Rethinking Final Project

When I was designing the BB8 droid, I started to realize that some aspects of the original design were pretty sketchy.

If you look at this [photo](https://cdn.instructables.com/FL7/BFW3/IINF6VP6/FL7BFW3IINF6VP6.MEDIUM.jpg) from the [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Bluetooth-Phone-Controlled-BB-8-Droid-With-Ard/), you'll notice that there isn't actually any sort of mechanical stabilization. It's just weighted down, and the only form of support is the motor axle.

This is on many levels incredibly sketch. How much torque can those axles support? Is that system actually any stable? Also, there is no actual weight - it's just the battery that's used as a weight. The whole design seemed a bit patchy.

In addition, in the comments section of the instructable, not a single person has said that they actually finished the project. Rather, many raised concerns similar to mine.

I started look around for an alternative, but couldn't find one. I decided that the challenge of mechanical stabilization with the BB8 would be too hard to pursue. Instead, I would just attempt the weather station project.

I decided that, to make it more like a robot, I'd extend it from a weather station to an automated plant watering system. It would use data about soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light to control how much water the soil needed.

I decided I'd also have the system pull down a rain cap when the air gets too humid. Just for a cutesy polished aspect, I'd model this cap after [My Neighbor Totoro](https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/images/reviews/196/full/1370237128_1.jpg).
