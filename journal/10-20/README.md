# Parts List for Final Project

I started by coming up with a list of parts for the sphero / BB8 project.

The primary design was inspired by this [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Bluetooth-Phone-Controlled-BB-8-Droid-With-Ard/). Essentially, the controller is weighted upright, and motors turn the ball around the controller.

**Parts list**

- controller
	- Arduino mini
	- battery (7-12v: probably LiPo)
	- bluetooth shield / breakout
- head
	- magnets
	- servo
- body
	- hamster ball
	- DC motors (geared)
		- need to be quite strong
