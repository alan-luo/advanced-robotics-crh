# Totoro Illustrator File

I didn't get a lot of work done for today because I was presenting my summer research to the school yesterday. I had spent all my time preparing for that.

However, I did set up an Illustrator file for engraving and cutting a totoro. Using Photoshop, I separated him into arms and a body so I could cut the two separately. I did the tracing myself.
