# Advanced Robotics (Fall 2017)

This is my repository for the Advanced Robotics class that I took Fall 2017 at Choate Rosemary Hall. The primary component of this repository is the engineering journal, which is found in the `journal` folder. It is organized by date, with each entry containing code and photos/videos.
